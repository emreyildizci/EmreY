#### *Where do these words come from?*
They are from the books I read.

#### *What do I do with these?*
I have a flashcard set on Quizlet. I plan on switching to a different app to incorporate the spaced repetition technique.

I set up a system where I give chatgpt the word and the sentence it is in (to provide context). It gives me the definition. It also keeps a running list and gives me the list when I want them to batch import to Quizlet
