# Steps
> [!tip]- Trying new beans?
> 1. Weigh coffee (around 16-18g)
> 	- Dark -> less coffee
> 	- Light -> more coffee
> 2. Guess the grind level
> 	- Not much to do at this point. Use your prior knowledge about the brand/origin/roast level etc.
> 	- Incline towards grinding fine to create less mess
1. Grind (always weigh the beans or use pre-weighed)
2. Put into the basket (use a funnel to create less mess)
3. Use your WDT
4. Use your hand to level the surface and get rid of excess
5. Tamp
6. Run an empty shot (5-10s) to get rid of the built-up steam
7. Put the portafilter, cup *and scale*
8. Push the shot button and the timer at the same time
9. Hold the button until the sound coming from the machine changes 
	- This is pre-infusion, most machines (including Bambino) have programmed pre-infusion time
	- This helps wet and saturate the grounds before pumping the pressurized water to get less channeling
10. Wait until you get roughly a 1:2 bean-to-yield ratio and stop
	- It should take roughly 25-45s
> [!tip]- Trying new beans or not happy with the taste?
> - Aim for this ratio but don't worry about being precise
> - Your shot will likely be either too fast or too slow
> - For the next shot, adjust the grind level so the shot duration is in the 25-45s range
> - *Important:* taste the coffee
> - Sour (likely also intense) -> Increase the ratio while still aiming for 25-45s, adjust grind level if necessary
> - Bitter (likely also watery) -> Decrease the ratio while still aiming for 25-45s, adjust the grind level if necessary

> [!Tip]- Some notes
> - Scale is the most important "extra" accessory here (and cheap too, just get one)
> - Having a tamper that fits snuggly to the basket is important as otherwise the perimeter will be over-extracted and the center will be under-extracted
> - Bottomless portafilter helps diagnose and improve the shot (and much more pleasing to the eye, unfortunately much more messy too)
