# Notes
- Tool 1 - Spend a long time defining a single priority/goal
	- One goal at a time
- Tool 2 - Set a hard to achieve goal
	- You need to feel challenged
- Tool 3 - Define specific and measurable verb actions
	- Write it on a paper
	- Very detailed durations etc.
- Myth 1 - Post it or visual reminder is a myth
	- Need to update them every day
- Myth 2 - "Tell the world" is a myth
	- Getting the positive feedback by simply saying what you want to or going to achieve
	- Having a strict accountability partner who checks in on you is a good thing to have
- Intrinsic motivation is the best motivation
- Tool 4 - The goal needs to be measurable
	- How long do you think it will take?
	- How much time you need to spend each day/week
	- Timeframe
		- Define a 12-week goal as a macro time
		- Hours per week
		- Hours per day
		- Which days of the week
- Tool 5 - Quantifying the goal
	- Actions are quantifiable
	- The amount of time is quantifiable
- Tool 6 - Visualizing the end before work
	- Do I want to do the things required (previously discussed/thought)?
	- ==When you feel motivated and just before engaging with the day's work== 1-5 minutes of visualizing the version of you who achieved the goal boosts it
	- ==If you have a hard time engaging with the work==, positive visualizing undermines the work. Instead, you should visualize the failure, scare yourself
- Tool 7 - Focusing the visual attention within a work/action block increases focus
	- If you feel distracted or if you lose motivation, find a visual target near your work, and focus your vision on the target for 30-90 seconds. That will increase focus and motivation and sustainability of them
	- If your eyes feel tired, go into the panoramic view (blink, see the edges of the vision)
- Tool 8 - Block the phone
- Tool 9 - Random intermittent reinforcement
	- Randomly reward and non-reward yourself
	- When you complete a work, flip a coin and reward 50% of the time, other 50% you move on to another work
	- This is true for both internal and external rewards. Even reminding yourself that you are in the right direction, and performing well etc.
- Tool 10 - "Middle problem" - The lack of motivation when you are past the beginning phase and before the end
	- Acknowledge it
	- Chunk up the middle section, and try to make it easier
	- This can be done within each work block and across the work blocks (within a week, a month)
- Tool 11 - Circadian rhythms and attention
	- 30 mins, 3 hours, and 11 hours after waking up, you have the highest focus/attention/motivation (available dopamine)
	- Schedule accordingly even if roughly
