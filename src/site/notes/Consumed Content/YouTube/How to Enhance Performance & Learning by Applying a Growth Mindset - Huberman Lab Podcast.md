# Notes
- Growth mindset emphasizes distancing yourself, i.e. identity, from performance
- Especially problematic for good performance, i.e successful
- Growth mindset is seeing our abilities as flexible rather than fixed
- Neuroplasticity happens at best 0-25 but can happen afterwards
- **Mindset organizes** information
- Intelligence isn't fixed
> [!info]- Attaches narratives, I'm bad at music, good at science
> - Do these narratives come from outside or inside?
> - Why am I good/bad at this?

> [!exp]- Praise for intelligence can undermine motivation and performance
> - Effort feedback vs intelligence feedback
> - Intelligence feedback is tied to identity
> - Effort feedback is tied to verbs
> - Effort guys do better than intelligence ppl
> - Effort guys choose hard problems and vice versa
> #### Results
> - Narratives that we receive from others steer us in certain directions
> - Giving effort praise increase performance and vice versa
> - Kids that got intelligence praise tend to misrepresent, e.g. lie, about their performances

> [!tip]- Challenging narratives
> - Find what you are good/bad at
> - Hear the narrative
> - Shift the intelligence-based narrative to effort based narrative
> - **Ex1**: I'm good at productivity -> I spent time learning about productivity and its practical applications
> - **Ex2**: `~{I'm bad at stopping my cravings or controlling my appetite -> I haven't prioritized paying much attention to my meals or what I eat. I only focused on the end product rather than paying attention to and putting effort into what I eat}`

> [!exp]- Growth vs fixed mindsets
> - Fixed mindset people got affected by their mistakes emotionally
> - Growth mindset people redirected their attention to learning or correcting the mistake

> [!exp]- **Stress-is-enhancing** mindset
> - How we are thinking about stress impacts how we react to stress
> - People informed about the diminishing effects of stress -> Performance diminishes
> - Vice versa -> Performance enchanced
