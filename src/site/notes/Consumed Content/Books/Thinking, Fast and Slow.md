# Notes
- Cognitive busyness
	- Self-control and cognitive efforts are forms of mental work. You are more likely to indulge in something when you are busy with a cognitive task
	- System 1 has more influence on behavior when System 2 is busy
- Ego depletion
	- Willpower has limited source
	- When you do something requiring self control you are less likely to do another thing that requires self control afterwards
- Ego depletion isn't the same mental state as cognitive busyness
	- You can increase the motivation to overcome the effect of ego depletion but you cannot reduce the increased effort required to do a task while cognitively busy
- If you are given a question, or a problem, or required to make a decision, you might have an intuitive answer/decision that pops up (almost) immediately. This "reaction" is involuntary, an act of system 1. Then:
	- How likely you question this reaction is one thing (called rationality in the book)
	- How easy, or how well you access the information relevant to this action is another thing (intelligence)
- Things prime to other things
	- A word makes you think about that word as well as other things that are associated (both objectively and subjectively) with that word
	- Furthermore it primes other things associated. Word "old" makes you feel (or act) like old
	- Doesn't have to be a word, anything can prime other things. A picture of money in the background can make you behave more individualistically
- Cognitive ease

- Cognitive strain mobilizes System 2, therefore makes you think more thoroughly
- Familiarity doesn't need to be on the conscience level
- When in good mood, we rely more on intuition (system 1) and therefore activate system 2 less
- We create narratives with System 1

# Review
- It is more like a scientific research than a nonfiction
