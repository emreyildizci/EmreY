# Notes
- Build ==sharing== into the routine
- Find a scenius, good work isn't created in vacuum, it is created in "ecology of talent"
- Be an amateur, find the voids, and fill them imperfectly
- Record and ==document== yourself doing your work, take photos, videos, and notes
- ==Daily dispatch==, share your daily work/progress
- Share your curiosities
- No guilty pleasures
- Work doesn't speak for itself, share the story
- You are in the middle of an unfinished story, structure it before telling it. Past (how have you worked on it etc.), now (what you have/are now), future
- If you want to be noticed, you need to notice and make it seen
- Avoid the vampires
