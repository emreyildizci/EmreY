## Preface
- The book is about the ethnic cleansing, which is referred to as "Nakba" that took place in 1948.
- The Israeli narrative had been it was a "voluntary flight".
- It was challenged by a movement called "New History (wiki ref.)", which Ilan Pappe was a member of, in the 1980s. But some historians, one of them being Benny Morris (wiki ref.), challenged this view solely based on the Israeli military reports taken at face value or as absolute truth and hence, only draw a partial picture in which the "part of" the indigenous people were "tragically but inevitably" moved
- There has been attempts from the Palestinian historians, one of the prominent one being Walid Khalidi, also but neither those nor the New Historians' attempts failed to enter the public realm of moral conscience and action.
- The Zionist movement had strategies in play to achieve this
	- This "complex" issue cannot be understood by the "foreigners"
	- They shouldn't be allowed to interfere unless they accept the Israeli point of view
	- The more "civilized" side of this conflict should find a solution for "themselves" and for "the other, uncivilized" side, Palestinians
	- As the US adopted this approach, we had a "peace process" that leads to nowhere, as it ignores the heart of the matter
# An "Alleged" Ethnic Cleansing?
"It is the present writer’s view that ethnic cleansing is a well-defined policy of a particular group of persons to systematically eliminate another group from a given territory on the basis of religious, ethnic or national origin. Such a policy involves violence and is very often connected with military operations. It is to be achieved by all possible means, from discrimination to extermination, and entails violations of human rights and international humanitarian law . . . Most ethnic cleansing methods are grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and 1977 Additional Protocols."

### Definitions of Ethnic Cleansing
- Drazen Petrovic associates ethnic cleansing with nationalism and the making of new nation states. From this perspective he exposes the close connection between ==politicians== and the army in the perpetration of the crime and comments on the place of massacres within it. So the political leadership doesn't involve in the systematic planning or provide explicit instructions but makes the overall objective clear for the army.
- So in Nakba, the political leadership cease to take active part as the machinery was in action and was rolling on
- Massacres don't have to be committed as a result of a master plan, they accompany and accelerate the operation
- With this definition, Nakba was a clear-cut case ethnic cleansing
- I don't detail it here but the definitions adapted by most entities include that ethnic cleansing is a crime against humanity not against the particular group it is perpetuated to
#### Emre's notes (make callout)
My knowledge in Nakba is quite limited (hopefully will improve as I read on), but the operations following the October 7 is possibly even more clear-cut case ethnic cleansing than Nakba.
Remember that in the case brought up by South Africa, comments from the Israeli leadership was used extensively as evidences
### Popular Definition
This chapter is about wikipedia referring to Nakba as an "alleged" ethnic cleansing case. However, as of August 3, 2024 the wikipedia entry "[Ethnic Cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing)" doesn't have a list of cases and the entry "[Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba#CITEREFPappe2022)" starts with "*The Nakba (Arabic: النَّكْبَة, romanized: an-Nakba, lit. 'the catastrophe') is the ethnic cleansing[1] of Palestinians...*" and the reference [1] includes this very book.
### Ethnic Cleansing as a Crime
Ethnic cleansing is designated as a crime against humanity in intl treaties, such as that which created the ICC in The Hague

The perpetrators of this ethnic cleansing are not obscure. The list begins with the leader of the Zionist movement, [[David Ben-Gurion\|David Ben-Gurion]]. He was aided by a small group of committee members whose purpose solely was to plotting and designing the ethnic cleansing. This group included top-ranking officers of the future Jewish State's army, 'Orientalists' who know the Arab world and Palestinians. They were assisted by regional commanders who were not just Israeli war heroes, they also contributed to the founding of the Jewish State.

# The Drive for an Exclusively Jewish State
## Zionism's Ideological Motivation
Zionism emerged in the late 1880s in central and eastern Europe as a national revival movement, prompted by the growing pressure on Jews in those regions either to assimilate totally or risk continuing persecution

By the beginning of the twentieth century, most of the leaders of the Zionist movement associated this national revival with the colonization of Palestine. Others, especially the founder of the movement, Theodor Herzl, were more ambivalent, but after his death, in 1904, the orientation towards Palestine was fixed.

Eretz Israel, the name for Palestine in the Jewish religion, had been a place for holy pilgrimage for generations of Jews. Jewish tradition and religion clearly instruct Jews to await the coming of the promised Messiah at ‘the end of times’ before they can return to Eretz Israel as a sovereign people in a Jewish theocracy, that is, as the obedient servants of God (this is why today several streams of Ultra-Orthodox Jews are either non or anti- Zionist). In other words, Zionism secularized and nationalized Judaism.

Zionist thinkers reclaimed the biblical territory as the cradle of their nationalist movement. To them, it was an occupied land by "strangers" and had to be repossessed. "Strangers" here meant non-jewish population of Palestine. In fact for some those "strangers" were just obstacles or nature's hardship to be overcome.

Some Palestinian leaders realized that the Zionists were aiming to purchase land, assets and power in Palestine but the destructive potential was not fully comprehended before the WW1. It was seen as a part of the European colonialist drive, which in part it was. There had been attempts by some Palestinian intellectuals to convince the Ottoman government in Istanbul to limit, if not prohibit, the Jewish immigration and settlement into Palestine

Others around Palestine, such as the leading Egyptian literati, saw the movement of Jews into Palestine as part of Europeans' transfer their poorest people. To them, this posed a minor threat compared with the churches taking over the "Holy Land".

In addition, according to a more critical view, various Protestant governments in Europe dreamed a "Christian" Palestine and wanted to take it away from the Ottomans. They saw the return of Jews to Palestine as a chapter in the divine scheme

In 1917, British Foreign Secretary Lord ==Balfour== gave the Zionist movement his promise to establish a national home for the Jews in Palestine while promising non-Jewish population to protect their aspirations. By the end of the 1920s
