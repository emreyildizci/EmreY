- Incentives play a big role in economy
	- A service provider has an incentive to provide a good service to you to earn your trust or similar
	- Incentive of a customer should align with that of a service provider, but how about the magnitudes?
	- Consider the case of selling a house through a real estate agency. A real estate agent has an incentive to sell your house at a high price because they earn commission
	- Consider a house to be sold for around $300,000 with a commission of 6%. The commissioners on each side of the transaction get 3% each. Then half of it goes to the agency, so a real estate agent earns 1.5% which is $4,500. Which is a good money, i.e. good incentive, but how about the incentive to sell the house for a little more. Selling the house for $310,000 would benefits the owner for an additional $9,400 but the agent gets mere $150. So the incentive isn't big enough for the agent, so agent doesn't care about that additional $10,000 price increase, so they wouldn't be as patient as the house owner to wait for the best offer. Hence they would push the owner to sell it as soon as there's a good enough offer
