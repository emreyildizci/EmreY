This article will contain my reflections on the book, it is not a book summary. I mainly will follow the book content though.
- How I define productivity (and a few words about how I approach it)?
	- Each and every one of us has a limited resource called **time**. What is special about it is you cannot choose not to use it as oppose to money for example which you can save up and use later. So, you can be unclear about how you *intend* to use money for however long you want. But with time, intention is extremely important because you cannot hold on to it.
	- So I see productivity being composed of two main components: intention and execution. As long as you spend your time (execution) on what you want (intention), you are productive. Therefore, a college student who wants to spend time with friends all year while barely passing the classes could be as productive as a Nobel laureate or a CEO of a you-choose-how-many-figures company with one millionth of an effort.

# Energize
## Play
It is obvious that we humans, or even most animals enjoy play. It is almost baked in the definition of play. So it is only natural to look into play and draw strategies from it
- Create an adventure
	- The way we enjoy games differ. Some play soccer just to beat the opponent, some just to score goals, and some, like me, find a challenge and play the game just to score the best goal or dribble the entire opponent team. So what we can do is find our play personalities (8 listed in the book) and apply them to our day to day lives.

- Embrace your curiosity
	- Pretty straightforward. Give more freedom to your mind to wander

- Think of how to make anything fun
	- As daunting a task may be there could be a way to make it more fun (or slightly less miserable). Listening to music, lighting a candle etc.

## Power
- Confidence switch
	- When you find yourself unconfident, you can act as if you suddenly become confident
	- To understand why this works, let me attempt to explain how confidence works. Confidence is basically our own assessment of our ability. It stems from past experience, preparations etc. but it is not necessarily immune to present conditions. In fact one could argue that present is just as relevant as past. You could feel confident in one setup but feel unconfident in another. So whenever you feel insecure about something you really have to do just convince yourself that you could act *as if* you are confident. It'll only make things better
## People
In this chapter, the first approach sets the foundation and the subsequent ones could be thought of different ways to utilize that approach
- The comrade mindset
	- We can think of teamwork as a psychological state rather than simply a way of dividing up tasks and people we work with as not just people we work in parallel but our teammates who we work together.
	- One way to implement this mindset is to ask for help and give credit for it as little as it can be.

- Find synchronicity
	- When we work in synch with others we feel like we are each others comrades even if our work is completely different
- Help people and ask for it whenever possible
# Unblock
## Seek clarity
There are 3 approaches to overcoming difficulty (in whatever form) and getting things done
**Motivation:** I can make myself *want* to do the thing because of the rewards, incentives, etc.
**Discipline:** I can *hate* doing the thing but I'll do it anyway because of whatever.
**Unblock:** I try to understand what's blocking me, recognize the challenges and work on removing them.
A potential process resulting in avoidance due to the fog of uncertainty could be this
1. Overestimate what's at stake
2. Be hypervigilant to the negative signs
3. Unable to recognize the positive signs or safety cues
4. Avoid
- Ask why and think of the intent and check if what you are doing aligns with your overarching intent
	- A particular task or a project might seem daunting or you could feel like stuck but as long as the intent is clear and what you are doing aligns with that intent you should be good
- NICE goals
	- Set goals that are
		- Near-term
		- Input-based
		- Controllable
		- Energizing
- Ask yourself questions to clear the path
	- We tend to interpret the signs wrongly in the heat of the moment so we can be prepared for them
		- Imagine you haven't started the task in one week, what are the top three reasons?
		- What can you do to eliminate them?
		- Who can you ask for help, be comrades with?
		- What can you do right now to increase the odds that you'll do the task?
## Find courage
Fear is another blocker
- Label the underlying emotion
	- Even simply identifying and saying what our fear is goes a long way towards dispersing it
- Stop spotlighting
	- No one ever thinks about you as much as you think. This is obvious when you think about it but only when you think about it
	- Make yourself remember constantly
## Get started
Even when everything is perfect, getting started is a challenge
- Reduce environmental friction
	- Set up your environment so that getting started is as easy as possible, even seconds matter
- Define the first action step and do it for 5-minutes
	- Make yourself start something just to do it for 5-minutes. After that feel free to go on or give up
- Track your progress
	- Even when things are going well, or if you foresee no big obstacles track your progress and see it
- Find small wins and forgive yourself for losses
	- When you want to do something but didn't it makes the thing more difficult to do and puts you in a damaging cycle
	- To mitigate this, we can celebrate the small wins
# Sustain
- Burnout is relative, if you exceed *your* capacity then you are heading towards an inevitable burnout
## Conserve
- Energy investment portfolio
	- List your dreams, hopes, ambitions on one side
	- List your active investments on the other
- Give yourself permission to be distracted
## Recharge
- Recharge/break portfolio
	- List things you do when you feel drained of energy
	- List things you do that actually energize
- Calm hobbies
	- **C**ompetence: Activities that make you feel competent, a sense of development, growth
	- **A**utonomy: Activities you have complete control over
	- **L**iberty: Activities that detach us from our *work mode*
	- **M**ellow: Activities that help us mellow, that are relaxed and low stakes
	- Ex: Painting, knitting
- Go to nature or bring in nature (photos, accessories etc.)
