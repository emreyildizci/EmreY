This article will contain my reflections of the book, it is not a book summary. I mainly will follow the book content.
- How I define productivity (and a few words about how I approach it)?
	- Each and every one of us has a limited resource called **time**. What is special about it is you cannot choose not to use it as oppose to money for example which you can save up and use later for example. So, you can be unclear about how you *intend* to use it for however long you want. But with time intention is extremely important because you cannot hold on to it.
	- So I see productivity being composed of two main components: intention and execution. As long as you spend your time (execution) on what you want (intention), you are productive. Therefore, a college student who wants to spend time with friends all year while barely passing the classes could be as productive as a Nobel laureate or a CEO of a you-choose-how-many-figures company with one millionth of an effort.
	- So, being more productive means (or at least should mean) you enjoy life better
## Play
It is obvious that we humans, or even most animals enjoy play. It is almost baked in the definition of play. So it is only natural to look into play and draw strategies from it
- Create an adventure
	- The way we enjoy games differ. Some play soccer just to beat the opponent, some just to score goals, and some, like me, find a challenge and play the game just to score the best goal or dribble the entire opponent team. So what we can do is find our play personalities (8 listed in the book) and apply them to our day to day lives.

- Embrace your curiosity
	- Pretty straightforward. Give more freedom to your mind to wander

- Think of how to make anything fun
	- As daunting a task may be there could be a way to make it more fun (or slightly less miserable). Listening to music, lighting a candle etc.

		- Brew a cup of tea/coffee ...
- Enjoy the process, not the outcome
	- Straightforward, didn't really resonate with me
- Reframe your failure
	- See failures as guidance. Again didn't really resonate with me
- Don't be serious, be sincere
	- I found this irrelevant
