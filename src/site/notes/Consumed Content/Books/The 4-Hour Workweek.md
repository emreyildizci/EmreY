# Notes
## Step 1: D is for definition
- D: To retire early or young
	NR: Distribute recovery periods and adventures, recognize inactivity isn't the goal, and doing exciting things is
- Emphasize strengths, don't fix weaknesses
- Doing the unrealistic is easier than doing the realistic
	- There simply is too much competition for realistic things since most people go for mediocre things instead of aiming for unrealistic
	- Aiming for a massive goal gives you much more motivation (adrenalin) than aiming for a slight improvement
		- Reading 1 book in two weeks is a mediocre goal and more prone to failure, 1 day of low mood could set it off. But reading 2 books in a week gives you the push required to read even when too busy, tired, etc.
- "What would excite me?"

## Step 2: E is for elimination
- Doing something unimportant well doesn't make it important
- Requiring a long time doesn't make a task important
- What you do is much more important than how you do.
- Assign more importance to the 20% that generates 80% of the outcome
- A task expands to eat up all the time you assign it to
- A task swell in importance (in your mind) and complexity in relation to the time allotted
- [ ] What 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness
- [ ] What 20% sources are resulting in 80% off my desired outcome and happiness?
- Don't consume irrelevant content, i.e. not actionable in the short term
- Only consume content that is relevant to ==immediate== and ==important== actions
- [ ] Think about notifications
	- [ ] Emails
	- [ ] Slack
- [x] Set focus modes
- [ ] Use chatgpt for automation
